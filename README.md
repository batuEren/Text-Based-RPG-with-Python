# Text Based RPG with Python
This is a project which i made when I was 12. It is made with python 3.6 and its default libraries. It is hard to call this a RPG accually because it only lastes like 3 minutes to finish. But it has multiple endings so it is kind of a "Choose Your Own Adventure" than a RPG
